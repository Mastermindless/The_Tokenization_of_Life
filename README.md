# The Tokenization of Life

A framework for seamlessly integrating discrete and continuous systems within a unified hybrid architecture.

## Overview

**The Tokenization of Life** project aims to bridge the gap between discrete and continuous data representations by integrating Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) with neural operators such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This hybrid architecture facilitates efficient processing and analysis of complex, multidimensional datasets, reflecting the interconnected complexities of fields like physics, chemistry, and biology.

## Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines GPT models with FNOs and GNNs to process both discrete tokens and continuous functions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale, hierarchical data inputs efficiently.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Promotes collaboration across diverse research domains.

## Repository Structure

- `compression/gpt-fno/`: Scripts and models for compressing GPT hidden layers using FNOs.
- `data/`: Sample datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources related to the project.
- `domain_gpt_models/biology/genomics/DNA_sequence_prediction/`: Domain-specific GPT models for DNA sequence prediction tasks.
